      summary: Mark shipments as being ready for shipping
      description: 'Manifest. Mark end of day for referenced sets of shipments.  Shipments are normally ''closed out'' at a fixed time of the day (such as 6 pm, configured by EKP/account) for the date provided as ShipmentDate in the create call. This call allows forcing the closeout for sets of shipments earlier. This will also override the original shipmentDate. Afterwards, the shipment cannot be changed and the shipment labels cannot be queried anymore (however they may remain cached for limited duration). Calling closeout repeatedly for the same shipments will result in HTTP 400 for the second call. HTTP 400 will also be returned if the automatic closeout happened prior to the call. It is however possible to add new shipments, they will be manifested as well and be part of the day''s manifest. Note on billing: The manifesting step has billing implications. Some products (Warenpost, Parcel International partially) are billed based on the shipment data available to DHL at the end of the day. All other products (including DHL Paket Standard) are billed based on production data. For more details, please contact your account representative. ## Input It''s changing the status of the shipment, so parameters are provided in the body. * ''profile'' attribute - for future use, it currently has no effect. * list of shipment IDs (it is currently required to provide the shipments explicitly, there is no __manifest all__ functionality yet) ## Output * Status for each shipment'

      summary: Retrieve shipment documents - labels and customs documents
      description: |-
        Returns documents for existing shipment(s). The call accepts multiple shipment numbers and will provide sets of documents for those. The **format (PDF,ZPL)** and **method of delivery (URL, encoded, data)** can be selected for **all** shipments and labels in that call. You cannot chose one format and delivery method for one label and different for another label within the same call. You can also specify if you want regular labels, return labels, cod labels, or customsDoc. Any combination is possible.

        The call returns for each shipment number the status indicator and the selected labels and documents. If a label type (for example a cod label) does not exist for a shipment, it will not be returned. This is not an error. If you were sending multiple shipments, you will get an HTTP 207 response (multistatus) with detailed status for each shipment. Other standard HTTP response codes (200, 400, 401, 429, 500) are possible as well. Labels can be either provided as part of the response (base64 encoded for PDF, text for ZPL) or via URL link for view and download (PDF). Note that the format settings per query parameters apply to the shipping label. Retoure label paper type can be specified separately since a different printer may be used here. If requesting labels to be returned as URL for separate download, the URLs provided can be shared.

        - Shipments and Labels
      summary: Create one or more shipments and their documents. __This is the primary call of the API.__
      description: ' Create one or more shipments and return corresponding shipment tracking numbers, labels, and documentation. Up to 30 shipments can be created in a single call. #### Validation  It is recommended to validate the request first prior to shipment creation by setting the `validate` query parameter to `true`.  This functionality supports both * JSON schema validation (against this API description). During development and test, it is recommended to do this validation. JSON schema is available for local validation (should be made available for download, until then, please ask) * Dry run against the DHL backend. If this succeeds, actual shipment creation will also succeed. ### Request You will need the chosen products, the desired product features (__services__), the corresponding billing numbers, and details about the packages you are planning to ship. Each shipment can have a dedicated shipper address. Please note that you can pick working samples for most products if you are using the try-out function. ### Response The call will return shipment numbers (which can be used for tracking) and the applicable labels for each shipment. If you were sending multiple shipments, you will get an `HTTP 207` response (multistatus) with detailed status for each shipment. Other standard HTTP response codes (401, 500, 400, 200, 429) are possible, too. Labels can be either provided as part of the response (base64 encoded for PDF, text for ZPL) or via URL link for view and download. Note that the format settings per query parameters apply to the shipping label. It _may_ also apply to other labels included, depending on the configuration of your account. Retoure label paper type can be specified separately since a different printer may be used here. If requesting labels to be returned as URL for separate download, the URLs provided can be shared and provide a very fast download experience. Further, it is possible to obtain only the data (routing information, barcode type, and shipmentnumber/trackingnumber per label.)'
